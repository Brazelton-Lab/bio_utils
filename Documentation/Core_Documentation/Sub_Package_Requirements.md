Sub_Package_Requirements
========================

*Author: Alex Hyer*

The following principles from [Philosophy](Philosophy.md) directly apply to
sub-packages:

1. Intuitive
2. As Simple As Possible
3. Heavily Documented
4. Logically Organized
5. Up-to-Date

This document serves as a practical coding guide to implement these concepts
into sub-packages. The following list summarizes the requirements of
sub-packages in bio_utils, each item is then discussed in detail:

1. At least two scripts per package
2. Avoid "Miscellaneous" packages
3. Import at the package level
4. Document in [Documentation](Documentation)
