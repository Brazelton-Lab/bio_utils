Summary
=======

bio_utils is a library of Python modules performing routine functions in
bioinformatic scripts.


Introduction
============

Many bioinformatic scripts perform similar or identical tasks internally
during the execution of a program. Such tasks include reading FASTA files or
filtering BLAST+ results. bio_utils contains numerous functions that quickly
and simply handle simple, mundane, everyday tasks in a streamlined and simple
fashion to save developers time. bio_utils aims to be as simple as possible,
providing functionality without adding in unnecessary features, i.e. bio_utils
is as vanilla as reasonable. This both increases the speed of most functions
and greatly simplifies APIs.

Many libraries, such as
`SCREED <https://screed.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9/>`_ and
`Biopython <http://biopython.org/>`_, already provide importable functions that
execute these simple tasks. SCREED maintains a fairly simple API but is fairly
slow and no one has updated the original repo since 2012-06-17. Numerous
developers actively maintain Biopython and it is quite a bit faster, in some
regards, than SCREED. However, Biopython stocks their functions with an
enormous number of features that, while useful in a Python interpreter, are
often ignored by programs or can be accomplished more quickly using built-in
Python features, i.e. Biopython is bloatware to many developers. As
aforementioned, bio_utils' vanilla design overcomes both these libraries issues
by providing both simplicity and speed.

At this point in time, bio_utils is quite small and its scope limited. The
authors intend to slowly but surely increase this library's repertoire over
time. We welcome any and all contributions to our project.
